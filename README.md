## Racing Game
A very simple racing game. There are two players. The goal is to win the race by
moving from left to right side of the screen. The player that reaches the right
side first win.  The first player(top) moves by pressing the z key. The second
player(bottom) moves by pressing the rigth arrow key.

## Issues
 - The announcing of the winner comes very much earlier than the displaying of
   the player movement.
 - The z-index does not work properly yet. Got around this by creating another
   div to hold the result display to have it shown at the bottom of the screen.

## History
08/23/2017 - initial creation
08/26/2017 - fixed the issue that the announcing of the winner comes very much
             earlier than the displaying of the player movement.
